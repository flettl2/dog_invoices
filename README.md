# dog_invoices

This code takes a list of MS Word documents submitted by dog walkers. Each Word document is an invoice for what dogs were walked and what type of walk they received that week.

These files are then transformed into csv files in a format the accounting software QuickBooks can import.
A separate csv file is created to reveal how much each dog walker should be paid that week.

Since combining this program with an auto import software, Puppy Dog Trails Inc. has averaged a time savings of 2 person hours/week of manual data entry.
